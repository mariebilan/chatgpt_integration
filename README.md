# chatgpt_integration

I created a thematic site with an example of how you can integrate chatgpt into your site.
The site is made in the dnd style.
For this we need CHATGPT_API_KEY and CHATGPT_API_URL. Everything else can be read in the files.
Below you can view a pdf with a presentation of my project.
